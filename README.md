A Simple, Easy to Use, Open Source GUI overclocking utility for AMDGPU on Linux.

Dependencies:
	python3,
	python3-tk (or similar depending on distribution)

How to use:

	Install all dependencies stated above.
	Run amdgpuoc.py as root. You can do this by running: sudo ./amdgpuoc.py in the directory you have saved it to.
		In case the script fails to run even when all dependencies are installed, try running chmod a+x amdgpuoc.py and trying again
